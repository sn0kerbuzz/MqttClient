# MqttClient

A simple wrapper over [knolleary](https://github.com/knolleary)'s [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) 
library. 

The goal of this library is to create a simple and elegant API. Also, adds a series of functionalities that
help in my other projects (eg. connection callbacks, auto-handle `loop` reconnect).
